#Fan Speed/RPM monitor
Uses a QTR-1A Reflectance Sensor to measure the speed of a spinning fan. Requires a dab of white TipEx, or similar, on the tip of ONE fan blade so that the reflectance sensor can detect one of the blades every rotation.

Noise is reduced by taking multiple readings and taking the average, speed is sacrificed by doing this.
